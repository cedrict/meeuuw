\section{Experiment=19:Donea \& Huerta manufactured solution}

This manufactured solution originates in the book of \textcite{dohu03}.
Boundary conditions are no-slip on all sides, 
density and viscosity are constant and equal to 1 inside the domain. 
The gravity vector is given by the following polynomial expressions:
The components of the body force $\vec{b}$ are prescribed as  
\begin{eqnarray}
g_x &=& (12 - 24z) x^4 + (-24 + 48z) x^3 + (-48z + 72z^2 - 48 z^3 + 12) x^2 \nonumber\\
    && + (-2 + 24z -72z^2+48z^3)x + 1-4z + 12z^2-8z^3 \nonumber\\ 
g_z &=& (8 - 48z + 48 z^2) x^3 + (-12 + 72z - 72z^2) x^2  \nonumber\\
    && + (4 - 24z + 48z^2 - 48z^3 + 24z^4) x - 12z^2 + 24z^3 - 12z^4  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
With this prescribed body force, the exact solution is  
\begin{eqnarray}
u(x,z) 
&=& x^2(1-x)^2 2z (z-1)(2z-1) \nonumber\\
w(x,z) 
&=& -z^2 (1 - z)^2 2x (x-1)(2x-1) \nonumber\\
p(x,z) &=& x(1 -x)- 1/6 \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
Note that the pressure obeys $\int_{\Omega} p \; dV = 0$.

The reason to carry out this experiment resides in 
the subsequent calculations of the $L_2$ errors of the 
velocity and pressure fields. These errors 
should decrease when the resolution is increased, at a given rate
as documented for example in \textcite{thba22}, \textcite{thba25}.

We then run a series of calculations from 
\lstinline{nelx=nelz=16} to \lstinline{nelx=nelz=128} and
recover the expected convergence rates:

We can also turn to the (direct) solver performance and look 
at the Stokes solve time as a function of the total number of degrees
of freedom:
