\section{Sinker in unit square box}



The domain is a unit square. The top 25\% of the domain is filled with sticky air. 
The fluid is characterised by $\rho_f=1$ and $\eta_f=1$. The sphere is characterised by $\rho_s=2$ and
$\eta_s=10^3$. The air is characterised by $\rho_a=0$ and $\eta_a=10^{-3}$. Gravity is 
vertical with $\vec{g}=-\vec{e}_y$.
The sphere has a radius $R_S=0.123456789$ and its center is at position $\vec{r}_c=(0.5,0.6)$. 
Boundary conditions are free slip on all sides (unless a true.
Pressure is normalised so that its average is zero on the top (if no free surface is used).

The initial distribution of particles is regular with $5^2$ particles per element.
