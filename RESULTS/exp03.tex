\section{Experiment 3: visco-plastic convection (Tosi et al, 2015)}

We here follow the same approach as in Experiment~0: there is a 
single fluid in the domain and the particles are not needed. 
We then set \lstinline{RKorder=-1} which freezes the particles to 
be collocated with the quadrature points.
